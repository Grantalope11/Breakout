2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net PS2C_IOBUF_inst/O is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): PS2C_IOBUF_inst/IBUF/O
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 CPU/prog_rom_port/ram_1024_x_18 has an input control pin CPU/prog_rom_port/ram_1024_x_18/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: CPU/prog_rom_port/Q[6]) which is driven by a register (CPU/pc_port/PC_CNT_reg[6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
